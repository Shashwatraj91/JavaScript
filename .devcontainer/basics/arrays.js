const myArr = [0,1,2,3,4,true,"Shashwat"] // array can be of different types 
    //and can be resizable after declaring the array
    //shallow copy means the copy will reference to the same memory location(done using heap)
    // Deep copy means the copy will not point to the same memory location(done using stack)
// Arrays can be decalared by various methods:-
//1.Method
const arr1=["shashwat","ram","shyam"]
//2.Method
const arr2=new Array(1,23,454,7,86,90)
